# Next Rainfall
A simple Node.js app based off When Will It Rain Next (http://wwirn.glitch.me)

## Environment Variables
Set API_KEY as your OpenWeatherMap API key.
Rename '.env_sample' to '.env' 

## OpenWeatherMap API
OpenWeatherMap API is a free weather APP that I used in this project.

## Geolocation API
I also used the Geolocation API to automatically get the users coordinates in lattitude and longitude
This may not work on some browsers and devices.
